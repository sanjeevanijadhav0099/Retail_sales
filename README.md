# Retail_sales
This project analyzes an online retail sales dataset to uncover key business insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA). Using SQL for data querying and Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for processing and visualization, I explore customer behavior, sales trends, product performance, and revenue patterns. Ideal for demonstrating real-world data analytics skills in retail and e-commerce.Dataset: Online Retail dataset  covering transactions from a UK-based online retailer (2010-2011), with ~500k records including invoice details, stock codes, quantities, prices, and customer IDs.
🛠️ Tech StackPython: Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizationsSQL: PostgreSQL queries for aggregation and filteringJupyter Notebook: Interactive EDA workflowEnvironment: Python 3.9+, requirements.txt included
📊 Key Insights & AnalysisSales Trends: Monthly/seasonal revenue patterns and top-performing productsCustomer Segmentation: RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) 
💡 Learning OutcomesEnd-to-end EDA pipeline: Data ingestion → Cleaning → Analysis → InsightsSQL optimization for large datasets (window functions, CTEs)Python for statistical analysis and storytelling with dataBusiness recommendations: e.g., target high-value UK customers, discount slow-movers
